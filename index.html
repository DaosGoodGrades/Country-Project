        <p>France, one of the oldest nations on Earth, located in Europe, is a country with a rich history, culture and cuisine. Today, it is also known as the country of love, making it the most visited country in the entire world.</p>
        <p> The national flag of France (drapeau national de la France) is a tricolour featuring three vertical bands coloured blue (hoist side), white, and red. The design was adopted after the French Revolution, whose revolutionaries were influenced by the horizontally striped red-white-blue flag of the Netherlands. </p>
